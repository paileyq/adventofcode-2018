# Advent of Code 2018

In past years, I tried to do [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) competitively and get on the leaderboard. It was very tiring keeping that up for a whole month. This year, I decided I needed to take a rust. I'm going to have a very rustful holiday and be sure to rustup for the new year.

What I'm trying to say is that I'm going to take it easy and learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for this Advent of Code, and also see if I can blog about it.

## Blog

1. [Chronal Calibration](blog/01-chronal-calibration.md)
1. [Inventory Management System](blog/02-inventory-management-system.md)

## Usage

This runs the solution for [day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1):

    cargo run 1

This runs the solution for [day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2):

    cargo run 2

And so on.

By default it uses the corresponding file in the `input/` folder as the puzzle input, but you can specify another file to use like this:

    cargo run 3 path/to/my/input03
